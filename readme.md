My first AI projects, using reinforcement learning, mostly read about theory at the University so decided to make my own implementations.
SDU University Odense, Denmark.

For the Jupyter files it is better to download and run them. 

Decided also to implement some of the supervised and unsupervised models I made or will have made. 

Enjoy !
